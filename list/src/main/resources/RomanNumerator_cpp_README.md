How it works:
=============

The toRoman() function converts an integer to a 
Roman numeral string by matching it against the 
values of Roman numerals from highest to lowest.

The main() function asks the user for a decimal 
number, then checks if it is within the valid 
range (1-3999) for Roman numeral conversion.

If valid, it prints the corresponding Roman 
numeral; otherwise, it shows an error message.

This program should be compiled and run in a 
C++ environment.
